Goal: Decompose a financial problem into functions
"""

# Problem: Calculate monthly budget and savings potential

# Step 1: Break down the problem
# What are the components of a budget?
# - Income
# - Fixed expenses (rent, insurance)
# - Variable expenses (food, entertainment)
# - Savings goal

# Step 2: Create functions for each component
def calculate_total_income(salary, side_hustle=0):
    """Calculate total monthly income"""
    # TODO: Implement this
    pass

def calculate_fixed_expenses(rent, insurance, phone, internet):
    """Add up monthly fixed costs"""
    # TODO: Implement this
    pass

def calculate_savings_potential(income, fixed_expenses, variable_expenses):
    """Determine how much can be saved"""
    # TODO: Implement this
    pass

def generate_budget_report(name, income, expenses, savings):
    """Create a formatted budget summary"""
    # TODO: Create a nice report
    pass

# Step 3: Test your functions
# income = calculate_total_income(3000, 500)
# print(f"Total income: ${income}")
